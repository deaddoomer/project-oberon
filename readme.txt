Project Oberon is a operating system and programming language designed and developed by Niklaus Wirth and his team at ETH.
While Project Oberon 2013 are based on custom RISC-5 processor, this version ported to generic Intel 386 processor and can run on top of host os. So you don't need emulators or non-standard hardware anymore ;)
